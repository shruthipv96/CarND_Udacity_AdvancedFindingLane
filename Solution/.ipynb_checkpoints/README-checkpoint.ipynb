But I ignored to maintain uniformity).*\n",

    "- I observed that the bumps in the road was very well identified and the output changed accordingly pretty good.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems:**\n",
    "- The pipeline fails when the video starts with a curve road. Because the histogram will be almost similar along the base line unless like a normal road where the lanes are distincitly seen in the histogram.\n",
    "- When there is too much of detection other than the lane, there is high posiblity for the histogram peak to shift the base points over there.\n",
    "- When there is a glass reflection in front of the camera, then there is some error in the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Improvement:**\n",
    "- More robust method should be done to find the lanes on top of the histogram peaks. Like we may consider the base position of the lane from the previous frame and add a weight to this histogram peaks.\n",
    "- We need to apply more transforms in some other colorspace or do some math on the gradient images to remove all the other detection.\n",
    "- Along with the output, we need to check against some standards of the lane like width of the lane etc. to make sure that the detection is reliable.\n"
